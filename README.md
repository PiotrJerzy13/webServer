# 🌐 Webserv

> "This is when you finally understand why a URL starts with HTTP."

## Overview

`Webserv` is a lightweight HTTP server written in **C++17**, built from scratch as part of the 42 curriculum. It supports essential HTTP features such as GET, POST, and DELETE methods, file uploads, CGI execution, and custom configuration via a config file.

This project was an in-depth journey into the internals of HTTP, non-blocking I/O, and socket programming, with a focus on resilience and protocol compliance.

## 📁 Example Configuration

Here's a minimal example of a config file:

```conf
server {
    listen 127.0.0.1:8080;
    server_name localhost;

    root ./www;
    index index.html;

    error_page 404 ./errors/404.html;

    location /upload {
        methods POST;
        upload_path ./uploads;
    }

    location /cgi-bin {
        cgi_extension .py;
        cgi_path /usr/bin/python3;
    }
}
```
